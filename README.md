This project analyzed TFL bus incidents from 2015 to 2018 to identify key trends and areas for improvement. Data was collected from DataWorld and analyzed using Power Query and data visualization techniques.

KEY FINDINGS:

Incident Trends: The number of incidents peaked in 2017 and declined in 2018.

Geographic Concentration: Westminster, Wandsworth, and Waltham Forest had the highest number of incidents.

Victim Profile: Passengers were the most affected group, with adults experiencing the most incidents. Female victims outnumbered male victims.

Severity: Most injuries were treated on-scene, but a significant number of serious and unrecorded injuries were also reported.

RECOMMENDATIONS:

Enhance Passenger Safety: Implement awareness campaigns and improve onboard safety measures.

Driver Training: Provide additional training for drivers, particularly in pedestrian-heavy areas.

Targeted Interventions: Investigate and address the root causes of incidents in high-risk boroughs.
Focus on High-Incident Garages: Identify and address operational challenges at garages like Plumstead and Holloway.

Vulnerable Group Support: Implement specific measures to protect children, the elderly, and adults.

Regular Safety Audits: Conduct periodic safety audits of high-risk routes.

These recommendations aim to help TFL reduce the risk of bus incidents and improve the safety of the London transport system.
